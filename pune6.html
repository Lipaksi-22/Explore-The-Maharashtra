      <h2>Aga Khan Palace</h2>
      <p>Contrary to its name, Aga Khan Palace functioned as a prison to Mahatma Gandhi, Kasturba Gandhi and Mahadev Bhai Desai, secretary of Gandhi between August 1942 and May 1944. Aga Khan Palace, though, had other purposes when Sultan Muhammed Shah Aga Khan III built it in the year 1892. It was built with a view to help those in neighborhood who suffered the worst effects of famine. Aga Khan the Fourth donated this palace to the people of the country as a mark of respect to Mahatma Gandhi. A fine specimen for architectural excellence with lush greenery around, the palace is frequented by tourists to visit Gandhi’s memorial and memorials of Kasturba and Gandhi’s secretary who breathed their last here.</p>

        The mighty edifice of Aga Khan Palace is situated in Pune and was built by Sultan Muhammed Shah Aga Khan III in the year 1892. It is one of the most important landmarks in Indian history and has been instrumental in many defining moments of India's independence. It was once the site where Mahatma Gandhi, his wife Kasturba Gandhi, as well as Sarojini Naidu and Mahadev Desai were held prisoners. Aga Khan Palace is well known both for its architectural excellence as well as its historical significance. Spread over a vast land of 19 acres, the palace is now the headquarters of the Gandhi National Memorial society. Here, making khadi is still one of the prime activities. 
       <p>The Sultan built the palace to support the poor in the neighbouring areas who were hit by a famine. In the memory of Kasturba Gandhi and Mahadev Desai, architect Charles Corea had their memorials built in the premises of the palace. The palace houses a museum which holds a rich collection of pictures. There are also other items like the personal belongings of Gandhi. The Palace also has the ashes of Mahatma Gandhi buried in its ground. In 2003, the monument was declared to be of national importance.</p>
