      <h2>SarasBaug</h2>
      <p>The temple was also used for military strategy discussions by the Marathas against the Nizam and the British Empire in the 18th & 19th century as it was situated away from the Parvati Temple. Earlier the garden was not in place and there was a lake and a small temple at the center. The temple used to be called as "Talyatla Ganapati" (Ganesh temple in the lake). The Peshwa, his commander, and the advisors would go in the lake by boat to discuss the issue and plans. It is also recorded that the boats were steered by non-natives like Africans for complete secrecy, as they did not understand the local Marathi language.</p>
      <ul>
        The temple and the area surrounding it were renovated several times in the last 2 centuries. One of the renovations was carried out in 1842 with the help of the East India Company of the British empire. 
       <p>In 1995, a small museum, displaying over a few hundred idols of Lord Ganesha, was added to the temple premises.</p>
